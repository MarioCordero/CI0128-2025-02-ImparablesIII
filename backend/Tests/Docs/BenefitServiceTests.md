## Test Structure

The tests use:

- **MSTest** as the testing framework
- **Moq** for mocking dependencies
- **Arrange-Act-Assert** pattern for clear test structure
- **Comprehensive mocking** to isolate the service under test

## Dependencies Mocked

- `IBenefitRepository` - Mocked to control database operations
- `IProjectRepository` - Mocked to control company/project operations

## Test Data

Tests use realistic test data that matches the business domain:

- Company IDs, benefit names, calculation types
- Proper validation of business rules
- Edge cases and error scenarios

## Test Results

```

## Notes

- All tests are async and properly await operations
- Mock verification ensures correct interaction with dependencies
- Tests cover both success and failure scenarios
- String trimming and validation are thoroughly tested
- Tests are properly isolated from the main project
